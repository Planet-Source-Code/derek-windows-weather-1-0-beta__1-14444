edit\project1.vbp compiles to convert.exe in the same directory 
as \Program\project1.vbp compiles to Weather.exe

Location.dll and Zipcode.dll must also be in the same directory
as the two files compiled.

msinet.ocx & listboxocx.ocx needs to be included to run Weather.exe

This Program is in early beta, I just started it about 3 days ago and I
